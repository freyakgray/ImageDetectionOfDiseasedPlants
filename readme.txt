CS3120 - Machine Learning
Final Project

List of folders/files
AccuracyAndLossGraphs - pyplot graphs of accuracy and loss for models. Generated for 10,25 and 50 epochs.
ModelArchitecture - images of each models summary/architecture
plantvillagedataset - contains the PlantVillage dataset
SavedModels - saved models for each architecture. Trained on 10,25 and 50 epochs. Currently contains 50 epoch trained models due to size.
AlexNetRGB.py - implementation and training of AlexNet. Saves model to SavedModels
allModels.py - imports saved models, runs prediction from saved model
FinalProject_Gray_Henry.pdf - project report. Also submitted to canvas separately
HenryGrayFinalPresentation.pdf - slides used for video presentation
InceptionV3RGB.py - transfer learning of InceptionV3. Saves model to SavedModels
ZFNetRGB.py - implementation and training of ZFNet. Saves model to SavedModels
